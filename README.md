# DeployingDeepLearningImageClassifier

This project is about creating an application that will take a photo of a food item, then return the image name with an associated probability. This can be a helpful application to aid in food recognition. This application will run on a website on the computer and also on a phone. 

## Project Outline:

- Train a deep learning model using TensorFlow.
- Store that model on a server and locally.
- Create a web application that allows users to upload an image or URL of a food item and return the predicted image class name with some probability.
- Create a mobile application that allows users to take a photo or upload an image from their phone and returns the predicted image class name with some probability.

## Tech Stack:

- Colab: Train deep learning models using GPU
- TensorFlow/Keras: Open source libraries to perform deep learning
- TensorFlow.js: Use the TensorFlow ecosystem to deploy the deep learning model
- FastAPI: Create the web application
- Docker: Deploy the web application
- Heroku/GitHub Pages: Deploy the web application
- Expo/ReactNative: Deploy the mobile application
- Node.js/NVM: Deploy the mobile application
